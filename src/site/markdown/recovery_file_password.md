#### Select the `Checker`
   
A checker is the tool to attempt each possible password. Different file type needs different checker.

* `Archive Checker(Using 7z.exe)`: Support common archive files like: `7z/rar/zip/...`. It needs to config the path of `7z.exe` by `Configuration->Confinguration`.

#### Select the type of generating possible passwords

There are two types of generating possible passwords: brute-force and dictionary. The latter is more efficient, but you need select one password dictionary. 
`ApkToolBoxGUI` does not provide any dictionary for legal reasons. However, it is quite easy to find and download the dictionary on Internet.

If you select dictionary: 

* Select on password dictionary
* Set thread number depend on your PC power
